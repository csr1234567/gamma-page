We want to separate our website into three parts. One is related to our study and academic research, one is related to our cultural development, and another one is related to our lives.

In our study and academic research part, we want to provide some useful tools in it such as the link and public account to use ChatGPT, Tofel and IELTScultura past exam papers and so on. We also want to set up a problem-solving part. In that part, students can share their notes and communicate with each other to solve problems (of course they can chat about other things). Also, they can form a group for certain subjects and finish hard homework together.

In our cultural development part, we will introduce gamma college including its members, aims, and unique activities only gamma college has. Also, we will put our college’s SDC constitution, our dubbing videos, and articles from our college members on it. 

In our lives’ part, we will accumulate photos and videos of our lives. We also want to update new stories of gamma and Westlake university in it. Therefore, we need an editor to record funny things happened in campus. He(she) can record and put this news through our website. We also want to give our website this functionality.
