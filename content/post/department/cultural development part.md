## Introduction

In our cultural development part, we will introduce gamma college including its members, aims, and unique activities only gamma college has. Also, we will put our collegeâ€™s SDC constitution, our dubbing videos, and articles from our college members on it.

## Goal

Our goal is to build an open, inclusive, and internationally-oriented academic space. In the academy, we can freely discuss issues, engage in group tasks, or participate in recreational activities and events. We hope that students in the academy can develop in a comprehensive and personalized manner. Therefore, we not only organize academic activities such as lectures and seminars to guide students' learning and lives but also arrange a wide range of activities such as baking, three-line poetry, and badminton tournaments to enhance students' various skills. After a year of study and life, every student in the academy has achieved personalized development. For example, Xiaoyixiao has become a versatile athlete and baking master, Yangyinghao has become a music prodigy, Songyihao and Chengsirui have become gaming experts, and Pangzhihong has become a philanthropic ambassador...

## unique activity

In the past year, we have organized numerous exciting activities such as paddleboarding, table tennis, and the "Once-in-a-Lifetime" academic events in the academy... For more details, please refer to the activities section.
