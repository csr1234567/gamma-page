## Introduction

To provide a platform for our schoolmates to change ideas on subject studying, we develop the academic space in our gamma college website. This academic space serves not only the members in gamma college but also the whole undergraduate group.
As our conception, the academic space has three functions:

First, it allows our students to post their questions and some of our students might willing to help the one who is troubled. It will be the quora or zhihu of Westlake. To make sure the well development of the ecosystem, it requires our enthusiasm to form a virtuous circle.

Second, it provides a way for students to find their books, articles, TOFEL/IELTS resources, etc. Maybe itâ€™s difficult built such a platform since the separation of these resources is unauthorized. 

Third, we want to give our undergraduates the access to use the Chatgpt, which is a powerful tool for us to learn knowledge. If the budget is allowed, we want to level up the CHatgpt to 4.0 version.
